   Join me in exploring one of the most interesting empires in the world. They had highways through the Andes Mountains, conquered many tribes and ruled over 10 MILLION people.
    It's not clear when the Inca civilization became a thing but we do know they had a lot of myths about how they came to be. One of the myths they had was that their god walked out of the pacific ocean to Lake Titicaca and made the different tribes. After he made the tribes, he buried them in the ground to emerge after the god went back to the ocean. The Incas thought they were made by the sun god specifically so they called themselves “The children of the sun.” A second myth, the first Incas to ever live were a brother and sister who were married and three more brother-sister siblings were born. After a while they left the cave to go find land for themselves and defeated the Chanca people with the help of stone warriors.
   Either way, we know that they found a place they called Cuzco and made that their home sometime around 1000 AD. 1438 AD a great leader named Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui who led an army to defeat the Chanca then began to expand the empire in all directions in search of plunder and food. His empire stretched across the Ande mountains; he had taken control of 4 or more tribes along the way. After he stopped growing his empire he made a system for tax and administration throughout the entire empire with the main headquarters being Cuzco. 
    Pachacuti’s son, Thupa Inca Yupanqui, expanded the empire a further 2,500 miles at this point they started calling their empire Tawantinsuyo meaning “land of the four quarters'.” From the capital Cuzco, the Incas had built massive highways stretching from the furthest south to the furthest north of the Inca empire through the Andes mountains which isn't easy to do without machines which they didn't have. After a time, they had 40,000 people governing a lot of land with 10 million people living in it speaking over 30 different languages. 
   They kept growing and would have gotten even bigger except the conquistadors came in and brought diseases. Slowly killing the empire until there wasn't much of it left. So why do I think this is one of the most interesting empires? It had highways before machinery was a thing, it had over 10 million people living in it and it had a tax and government system.

<h1>The Rise and Fall of Two Great Empires <h2>

<h2>By Bryce K </h2>
</header>

    Today you will join me on a journey through time to look at two of the biggest empires in ancient history, Rome and Greece.
     We will start off by looking at how Rome became a city to start with. No one really knows how Rome became a city but there are a lot of legends about it, this is one of them. In 753 BCE two demigod brothers Romulus and Remus wanted to make a city, but couldn't agree on who would rule. After a while Romulus killed Remus and then named the city after himself hence the name Rome. It was situated on the banks on the Tigris River making trade one of its main starting points. During the 7th-6th centuries BCE the Greeks came down and traded with the Romans and some decided to live with the Romans and brought the Greek culture to Rome. During this time Rome had 7 kings starting from Romulus ending with Tarquin who died in 550 BCE when his successor made Rome a republic. The reason Rome grew so quickly was because they would borrow an idea from someone else and improve on it to help themselves. After Rome became a republic it was already wealthy from trade and then they went to war with Carthage and they were enemies for a long time after. They made themself known not for trade but also war and quickly grew their city. After a while Rome's leaders became blind with greed and want of more wealth. They started relying on slaves to do all the work and put tons of Romans out of jobs. The Romans that were unemployed started making gangs and would hire themselves to the wealthy to do “jobs” for them. A little bit of time goes by and two brothers wanted to reform the Roman government but got killed standing up for what they believed in. Fast forward a long time and Rome has grown Huge in size and cant be ruled by one king so they had two kings at a time and then the fall. The fall started a long time ago in roman history when the wealthy became greeder and when they started relying on slaves to do everything so the unemployment rate kept climbing. The armies consisted of barbarian Mercenaries who only cared for pay and not if the empire got attacked or not. During this time the Goths started attacking Rome seeing how vulnerable it was and began chipping away at Rome slowly overtaking it. That's the fall of the Strongest Empire in Ancient History.
      Now time to see how the Greeks came to be. Between 4000 and 2900 BCE small tribes began moving into greece. Throughout Greece's time there have been a lot of civilizations including Cycladic 3200-1100 BCE, Minoan 2200-1500 BCE, and Mycenaean 1900-1100 BCE. All these cultures had their Pros and Cons. Without them the world would be way different because a lot of people who changed the world came from Greece like Aristotle, Plato, Homer and a lot more. Though Greece became one country the cities were not under one rule. Some of the most famous cities in ancient times were in Greece like Athens, Sparta, Syracuse and more. But in ancient times you weren't really well known unless you had a super strong army and great conquering power. As the civilizations grew so did Greece and then a few of the cities wanted to grow bigger and started conquering the other cities until it all came to one ruler. And that's when Greece started growing in size. The Greeks started going out further and further into the other countries' lands slowly chipping away at them until Greece became one of the biggest empires of the time. Fast forward a long long time you get to Alexander the Great who keeps growing the Greek empire bigger and bigger after his death all the Greek land was split between 4 people. After it was split the Romans began taking the Greek land until most of the Greek land was taken over and the Romans had a bigger empire then the greeks. 
    I know I missed a crazy amount of history but there is just way too much to go over everything in one report so I strongly encourage you to go online and read up on Roman and Greek History so you can see what all stuff i wasn't able to write down. Now you may be thinking why do I need to know about the Romans and the Greeks? I think seeing the different ways the two civilizations were similar and different is a great way to learn about them.

<h1> The Hindenburg </h1>
<h2> By Bryce K </h2>
</header>
</p>

<p> The Hindenburg is an airship that was built in 1936 by the Zeppelin company. It's over 800 feet long and filled with 7million cubic feet of hydrogen.</p>
<p> The Hindenburg is a passenger airship made for speed and luxury. The Hindenburg had a price of 400$ or more for a one way trip. It's also the fastest way to get across the Atlantic taking 2 ½ days to cross whereas the fastest ocean liner took 10 days to cross. </p>
<p> While the Hindenburg was landing it burst into flames because of a leak of hydrogen near the back of the blimp. After the gas ignited it was only a few seconds before the hindenburg was engulfed in flames and fell to the ground.
</p>
<p> The crash took place at lakehurst naval air base new jersey at the mooring dock they had built for the blimp. The crash killed 34 people of the 97 that were on board and 1 person on the ground. </p>
<p> Herbert Morrison who was on the scene was quoted as saying “It’s a terrific crash ladies and gentlemen” and “Oh the humanity”. </p>
