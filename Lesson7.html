<p>  The Emperor named Maxim killed the previous king to take the throne then married that king's wife who told the Vandals to come and kill Maxim for killing her husband. The Vandals came and ransacked Rome to almost nothing taking all the treasure and a lot of people as slaves. During this time no one was brave enough to take the throne to protect against the Vandals so they got what they wanted and Rome fell into the hands of the Vandals. </p>
